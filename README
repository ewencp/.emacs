This is my personal emacs configuration file, mostly customized for
writing text and code. The repository is self contained: you can
simply clone it to ~/.emacs.d/ and it will just work.  Ideally this
configuration is sufficient and all that needs to be customized is
personality.el, which specifies your personal information.
