This is my personal emacs configuration file, mostly customized for
writing text and code. The repository is self contained: you can
simply clone it to ~/.emacs.d/ and it will just work.  Ideally this
configuration is sufficient and all that needs to be customized is
personality.el, which specifies your personal information.

If you want good JavaScript highlighting, run build.sh, which just
byte-compiles a few .el files, which is required to get the JavaScript
syntax highlighting to be performant.
